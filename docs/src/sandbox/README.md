In software development, Product Managers occupy a strategic role; they sit at the intersection of product development, product quality and client satisfaction.

Unfortunately, much of the knowledge to hone or improve your skills as a Product Manager is locked away within corporate product teams or experienced individuals.

**PMPRO Society** is a collection of writings which PMs can use to navigate and grow in their profession.
