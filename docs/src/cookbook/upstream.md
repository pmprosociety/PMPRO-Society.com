# Upstream Process
The upstream process describes a methodology PMs can use to collect incoming ideas and transform them into products or features. 

Using this approach, PMs can methodically work toward achieving company goals and building awesome new applications.

The upstream process enhances (or sits on top of) the existing RnD life-cycle to ensure features are prioritized, validated and refined. In the event that the group needs to pivot to other priorities, the upstream process will help to you articulate which features should be dropped in order to change direction; a vital skill all PMs should to have!

## Upstream Objectives
What does the upstream process look to achieve?
+ Handle an expanding number of customer feature requests aka "ideas"
+ Prevent feature requests from getting lost in email or various other places
+ Build transparent roadmaps that can adapt quickly to agile environments
+ Only enhance existing RnD processes in place
+ Insights from customers are collected, prioritized and ranked
+ Notify customers that a feature has been pushed to production, closing the feedback loop
+ Easily keep roadmaps 1 to 2 releases ahead of RnD

## Terminology

| Term | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Goal   | Corresponds to a product vision for the upcoming 1-2 years. *ie Multi-cloud support (Azure, GCP, AWS)* |
| Initiative | Spans at most 6-9 months, may contain 3-10 epics and linked to 1 or more teams. *ie Kubernetes infrastructure adoption* |
| Epic    | Spans at most 1-3 months, linked to one team. *ie Containerize runtime engines* |
| Story    | Spans one man week, represents the minimal increment work item for the team. *documentation of the feature* |

## Key Interactions

### Ideas
New ideas or feature requests can come from many different places. This includes: product users, sales, competitors, internal stakeholders or from market analysis. Ideas represent the low-fidelity wish of your users which needs to be refined to a state where RnD can move forward with development. Using a wireframing approach to refinement helps to communicate ideas in a visual way. 

### Initiative
Once you have a collection of ideas, they need to be mapped to existing or new company initiatives. Initiatives represent a collection of epics/features to achieve a long term company goal. They typically span 6-9 months, contain 3-10 epics and linked to 1 more feature teams. Initiatives should be validated with internal stakeholders as it becomes a core input for your long-term roadmap.

### Epics
Epics are your feature unit which spans at most 1-3 months, corresponding to one development team, and linked to one or more initiatives. Epics have three statuses in the upstream process: todo, in refinement and ready for approval. Its your job as a PM to collaborate with the various stakeholders to move epics through this workflow. 

### Downstream
The Downstream box represents your existing SDLC and engineering processes. The diagram is showing how features are refined upstream, before being triaged to your engineering group. This ensures that the problem is properly defined and has ownership on the business side before deploying engineers.
