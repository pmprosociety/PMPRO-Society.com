# Product One-Pager

The one-pager is about distilling your product overview down to very specific language - describing what it is you do and in as clear and as plain language as possible. 

For someone who is new to your product and capabilities, the one-pager helps them to quickly ingest how the product works. More detailed information can always come in the form of presentations and demos. 

It's important to understand that this document is meant to be **skimmed** by your prospects; which means that simplicity of both content and layout is key to an effective one-pager. 

Don't be tempted to include a lot of text. Work to get your point across quickly and aggressively simplify language with each new revision with the team. 

## Sections

Content is key to effective product one-pagers, consider the following sections:

+ Start off with your product's **name** and develop a simple **tagline**.
+ Add **overview text** which describes your product, what it aims to do and for who? 
+ Highlight your solutions top **Features** and describe them.
+ Describe **How it works** in 3 to 4 easy steps. 
+ How does this solution help your customers? Describe the **benefits** which matter most
+ A **call to action** which highlights how a customer can reach out to you. 

Bonus section:

+ A **customer quote** on how your solution has improved their business
