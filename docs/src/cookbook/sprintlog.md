# The Sprint Log

As a part of the discovery phase, PMs collaborate with project stakeholders and architects to plot application development work across a timeline. This important exercise equips the PM with a plan for communicating how application development will progress.

The key output of sprint planning is an estimation of how long  development would take in terms of months or weeks. This can used to calculate overall project costs or build simple cashflow analysis. 

Its important to remember that sprint log development can take time to develop, especially if the problem space is new to the team. Don't rush this step, it means you and the team can execute on projects with more confidence. 

## Example Sprint Log
Good PMs will weigh on their prior experience and judgement when putting this plan together. Each application or process you build will influence and build your skill set.
