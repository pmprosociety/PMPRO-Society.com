# Defining Features

It's important for PMs to deliver features that have a high impact on the business. We do this by building feature specifications - a business case for why and how a feature should be developed, distributed and released.

For many product managers it's easy to get excited about new technologies and figuring out how to apply them to your domain. Break this bad habit by starting first with a feature specification. This approach forces you to build a plan around winning new business or reducing costs, through which all the exciting technology decisions will eventually flow.

Also, let's not forget that engineering resources are scarce, which means that the features you intend to build require buy-in from your business stakeholders. We use feature specifications to clearly articulate what it is we're trying to achieve as a business. The extra effort of planning with your team at the start of feature development will greatly ease the difficulties of implementation.


## Simple, Mock Feature Spec Example
Feature specs vary in complexity and depth. Below is a simple template to get started. Depending on your team processes, this specification may need to be expanded to account for areas like: privacy, UX, upgrades, performance, and/or security reviews.
