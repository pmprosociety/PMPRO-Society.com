# Prioritizing Features (RICE)

The RICE Method of product prioritization is used as a key measure for setting the priority order of features. Keep in mind that this technique is just one input for determining which feature should come first. It's helpful to take into consideration (in addition to the RICE Score) areas like the current business landscape, relationships, resources, technical debt ect. Scoring systems like RICE help you to understand what to build first. 

**RICE Score Calculation:**

**Reach** X **Impact** X **Confidence** / **Effort** = **RICE SCORE**

## REACH
Answers: How many customers will this feature impact?

The reach factor is an attempt to estimate how many users a given idea will reach (within a time period). Based on your specific product landscape, its up to you how you'll want to measure reach.

Will this feature primarily drive new customers? How many new customer sites will you roll out?

**Example**: 
Run a calculation to estimate customers how many customers will be impacted or REACH.

```
Reach = (estimated number of new customers) X  (estimated number of new sites per new partner)
```

## IMPACT
Answers: How will this feature idea impact individual users? 

It's a measure of key KPIs this feature will effect, like: decreasing customer acquisition costs, increasing customer retention and reducing support volume.

When defining an impact metric, make sure you can easily supply it a number value/score. 

**Example**: As an example, consider 'Total Related Sales Leads Lost' = count the number of sales leads lost by not having this feature.


## CONFIDENCE
Answers: How confident are we in our reach and impact estimates? 

Confidence allows PMs quantify if you've been overly optimistic with your scoring of impact and reach. This score will bring to light if the feature idea has enough substance behind it to warrant being prioritized high. 

**Example:**
| Percentage | Description       |
|------------|-------------------|
| 75%        | High confidence   |
| 50%        | Medium confidence |
| 25%        | Low confidence    |

## EFFORT
Answers: How much time and effort will this feature take?

Product t-shirt sizing exercise based on engineering level of effort - typically PMs rely on engineering leads for this value. 

**Example:**
T-shirt sizes equate to various person weeks

| Size | Description              |
|------|--------------------------|
| XXL  | More than 8 person weeks |
| XL   | 8 person weeks           |
| L    | 4 person weeks           |
| M    | 2 person weeks           |
| S    | 1 person weeks           |
| XS   | 0.5 person weeks         |
