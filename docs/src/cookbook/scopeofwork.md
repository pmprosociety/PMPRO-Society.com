# Scope of Work
This Scope of Work document sits somewhere in between a full blown feature specification and a services contract. Its advantage is reflected in the speed and agility one can move to close important pilot programs (sales deals) while simultaneously educating customers on the feature intent of their requested work. 

## Rally the Troops
When faced with a large feature request tied both to the success of customer pilot programs and time sensitive deals, make sure to pull in the proper team to build the scope of work; developers, architects and project managers will all be important assets for their input.  This is especially true if they'll be responsible for the eventual execution of feature development. 

## Define the Problem Upfront
Take time to fully define the customer problem before jumping into any technology fit or solution. No problem definition means you will fail to articulate the various trade-offs of a proposed solution. It's incredibly easy for a team to begin solving perceived customer problems with approaches which are interesting to them but, not in the best interest of the customer's demands. When the team huddles up to produce the Scope of Work document you should always start with the problem statement you're solving. 

## Do What's Required to Close the Deal
Break work into smaller components and prioritize development which will make a visible impact to your sales team and customer. It's likely this approach will lead to maintenance, scalability, security, connectivity (to name a few) burdens which will need to be addressed. Consider organizing this feature work into "phases" to set a clear expectation with the customer and your internal teams on which features will be developed first and which will roll into to ensure the long term survival of the approach.
