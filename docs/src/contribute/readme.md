## Pull Requests

We :heart: pull requests and we're continually working to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute.

We prefer pull requests which contain one article each. The more concise an article can stay, the easier they are to review and merge. A PMPRO maintainer will pick up your PR and review it as soon as they can. They may ask for changes or reject your pull request. This is not a reflection of you as a PM or a person. Please accept feedback graciously as we will also try to be sensitive when providing it.

Although we generally accept many PRs they can be rejected for many reasons. We will be as transparent as possible but it may simply be that you do not have the same context, historical knowledge or information regarding the roadmap that the maintainers have. We value the time you take to put together any contributions so we pledge to always be respectful of that time and will try to be as open as possible so that you don't waste it.

## Authority Points

Authority Points are PMPRO Society's measure of exceptional PM community leaders. 

Each completed pull request with changes merged into the master branch, will earn contributors an authority point. Authority Points are tallied and used to power the site leadership board at [Latest Pages](./latest/readme.md). 

## Releases

Releases for PMPRO are scheduled for the 1st and 15th of each month, and will include all accepted pull requests. 

Only submissions from contributors having PM experience and are working/worked at places like: Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Salesforce and Microsoft will be accepted into the knowledge base.
